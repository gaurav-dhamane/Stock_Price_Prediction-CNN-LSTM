# Stock_Price_Prediction-CNN-LSTM
Stock price prediction is a challenging task in the field of machine learning, and in this study,  we propose a novel approach that combines Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long  Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. Our objective is to develop an accurate regression  model that can forecast future stock prices based on historical data.
